					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>Experiment with basic javascript data types and Variables.</p>

					<br>
		
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p> The most difficult part of this lab was getting used to javascript, and even then the task for this 
						lab was not difficult. It was the first time I had to put a photo in my lab so Angela helped me since 
					she has already worked a lot with organizing photos with css. </p>
					<br>
					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p> Overall, the lab was simple enough but seeing the site come together was very satisfying. </p>
					<br>
					<h2>Results:</h2>
